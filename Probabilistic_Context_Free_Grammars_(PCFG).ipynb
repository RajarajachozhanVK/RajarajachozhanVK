        "To develop Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) that can handle natural language ambiguity by allocating probability to several parse\n",
        "trees and selecting the most likely one.\n",
        "1. Introduction to Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFG) in Natural Language Processing:\n",
        "Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) are an extension of Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) that incorporate probabilities into the\n",
        "production rules. This allows them to handle the inherent ambiguity in natural languages by assigning probabilities to different parse trees and\n",
        "choosing the most likely one. PCFGs are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) for tasks such as syntactic parsing, where the goal\n",
        "is to determine the grammatical structure of a sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.1 Context-Free Grammar (CFG):\n",
        "A CFG consists of a set of production rules that define how symbols in the language can be replaced with other symbols.\n",
        "A CFG is defined by a tuple(𝑁,Σ,𝑃,𝑆):\n",
        "𝑁: A set of non-terminal symbols.\n",
        "Σ: A set of terminal symbols (the actual words).\n",
        "𝑃: A set of production rules.\n",
        "𝑆: A start symbol.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.2 Probabilistic Extension:\n",
        "In a PCFG, each production rule is assigned a probability.\n",
        "The probabilities of all production rules for a given non-terminal symbol sum to 1.\n",
        "The probability of a parse tree is the product of the probabilities of the rules used to generate it.\n",
